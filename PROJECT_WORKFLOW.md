# Project Workflow

This document outlines the full workflow of the project, including navigation and feature descriptions.

## Overview
## Section 1 — System Entry Gate

When HR clicks on the portfolio link from the resume:  
He is taken to a dedicated entry screen, not the main portfolio content.

He sees:
- A full-screen, minimal interface with no navigation and no scroll.
- A neutral, distraction-free background.
- A primary note displayed at the center of the screen saying:
  - “__________”
- A secondary supporting note displayed below it saying:
  - “__________”
- A single call-to-action button labeled:
  - “__________”

No personal information, project details, skills, or technical data are visible on this screen.

### Purpose of this section
- To clearly communicate that the portfolio is interactive and system-driven.
- To distinguish the experience from a static or document-based portfolio.
- To introduce an intentional pause before entering the main system.
- To ensure HR proceeds only after a deliberate action.

### Interaction
- HR can perform only one action on this screen:
  - Click the primary call-to-action button.
- No alternative navigation paths or exits are available.

### Transition
- Once the call-to-action button is clicked:
  - The entry screen is dismissed.
  - The system transitions to the next section of the portfolio.
  - The recruiter enters the live portfolio environment.
