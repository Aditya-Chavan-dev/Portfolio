### [BOX 1: The Before (The Memory Game)]
**The Managing Director carried the mental burden of tracking 10+ sites daily.**
It was a high-stakes memory game. If they forgot to call a site, the attendance data was lost forever, forcing a reliance on unverified claims.

### [BOX 2: The Pain]
*   **Mental Fatigue:** Tracking 10+ sites mentally.
*   **Data Loss:** Forgotten calls = Lost revenue.
*   **Fraud Risk:** "He-said-she-said" claims.

### [BOX 3: The Fix]
*   **One-Tap:** Open App -> "Mark In" -> Done.
*   **Server Lock:** Immutable timestamp (No fakes).
*   **Instant Feedack:** Success card = Zero anxiety.

### [BOX 4: The After (The Pocket Assassin)]
**We shifted the burden from the Brain to the Pocket.**
The system eliminates valid input. The employee simply taps "Mark In," and the server locks the truth. Zero cognitive load, zero fraud, and absolute peace of mind.
